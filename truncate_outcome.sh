#"Truncate" generally means to shorten something by cutting off a part of it. In different contexts, it can refer to:
#Mathematics: Reducing a number to a specified number of decimal places without rounding. For example, truncating 3.14159 to two decimal places would give you 3.14.
#Data Management: Removing records or data from a database table, often done to clear all entries quickly without deleting the table itself.
#General Usage: Cutting off or shortening text, phrases, or even physical objects.
